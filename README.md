# RESTful interface provider for Xing API

I have many stuff in my Linux machine but Xing API only allows a Windows server.
As you know, deep learning or machine learning, back test are much easier on
Linux machines.

The program will run on Windows,
get process requests from Linux machines thorugh the RESTful API,
and connect to the broker with Xing API.
